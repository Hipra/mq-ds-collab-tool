# Prototype Collaboration Tool

## Prototype Isolation Rule

When working on a prototype, ONLY modify files under the specific `prototypes/<id>/` directory. Never modify files in other prototype directories.

## Stack

Prototypes use React + MUI with bare imports:

```jsx
import { Box, Typography } from '@mui/material';
```
