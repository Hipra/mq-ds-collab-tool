# Feature Landscape

**Domain:** MUI React Component Prototyping & Design-to-Dev Handoff Tool
**Researched:** 2026-02-27
**Confidence:** MEDIUM — Based on deep domain knowledge of Storybook, Figma, Zeplin, Plasmic, Chromatic; web research tools unavailable during this session. Core patterns are stable and well-established.

---

## Table Stakes

Features users expect from any prototyping/handoff tool. Missing = product feels incomplete or users revert to screenshots and Figma.

| Feature | Why Expected | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|--------------|------------|-------|
| **Live component rendering** | The entire value proposition — real MUI components, not screenshots | High | Requires sandboxed iframe or in-page React rendering; must handle component errors gracefully |
| **Shareable link per prototype** | Handoff without account required for recipients | Low-Med | URL must be stable; no auth wall for view-only access |
| **Component tree inspector** | Developers need to see component hierarchy and prop values before building | Med | Traverse rendered React fiber tree; show component name, props, nesting |
| **Prop inspector panel** | Show which MUI props are set on selected component | Med | Read from React DevTools bridge or static AST parse; display prop name + value + type |
| **Dark / light mode toggle** | MUI apps always have theme variants; design review without this is incomplete | Low | Wrap prototype in ThemeProvider; toggle via button |
| **Responsive preview** (breakpoint switcher) | Mobile-first MUI designs require xs/sm/md/lg/xl preview | Low-Med | Resize iframe/container to MUI breakpoint widths; label the breakpoint |
| **Prototype list / gallery** | Navigating to individual prototypes by URL alone is unusable | Low | Grid or list of prototypes with name, status, thumbnail/preview |
| **Status workflow** (draft → review → approved) | Teams need signal on what's ready for dev; without it, Slack fills with "is this final?" | Low | Enum field + update action; visible badge on list and detail view |
| **Inline text editing** (copywriter view) | Copywriters must not need to read JSX to change strings | Med | Detect text nodes in rendered tree; overlay edit handles; write back to stored prop data |
| **Error boundary / graceful failure** | Broken component code must not crash the whole app | Low | Per-prototype error boundary with readable error display |
| **Prototype search / filter** | Once >10 prototypes exist, a flat list is unusable | Low | Filter by name, status, date |

## Differentiators

Features that distinguish this tool from "just use Storybook" or "just send a Figma link." These are the reasons the team builds this instead of adopting an existing tool.

| Feature | Value Proposition | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| **Role-based view switching** (Designer / Copywriter / Developer) | Each stakeholder gets a focused UI — CW sees text handles, Dev sees inspector, Designer sees clean prototype | Med | Toggle that shows/hides panels and overlays per role; remembers preference per user/session |
| **MUI theme preview** (default + future custom tokens) | See how the prototype looks in the actual production theme, not a generic Material theme | Med | Accept a theme config object; apply via ThemeProvider; future: load custom token JSON |
| **Status-gated sharing** | Share a link that only shows approved prototypes, or a direct draft link with a "not final" banner | Low | Query param or route variant; "draft" watermark overlay |
| **Claude Code integration hints** | The AI generates the files — the tool should acknowledge this workflow (e.g., file path conventions, accepted import patterns, generation timestamp) | Low | Metadata in prototype record; surfaced in inspector as "generated by Claude Code on [date]" |
| **Multi-screen navigation preview** | 5–10 screens with in-prototype routing — not just isolated component demos | High | React Router (or similar) inside the sandbox; sidebar or tab strip to jump between screens |
| **Annotation layer for developers** | Highlight a component and see its MUI docs link, the exact import path, and which design token it uses | Med-High | Map component name to MUI docs URL; requires token introspection |
| **Keyboard shortcut navigation** | Power users cycle through screens and toggle panels without touching the mouse | Low | Standard shortcut map (e.g., `D`=dark, `L`=light, `1-5`=breakpoint, arrow keys=screen) |
| **Copy-to-clipboard component import** | Developer clicks component in inspector, gets `import { Button } from '@mui/material'` ready to paste | Low | Derive import from component name; write to clipboard |
| **Prototype versioning / history** | See when a prototype changed without needing git blame | High | Snapshot stored on each save; diff between snapshots — defer to v2 per PROJECT.md |

## Anti-Features

Features to deliberately NOT build in v1. Building these would slow delivery, add maintenance burden, and duplicate tools the team already uses.

| Anti-Feature | Why Avoid | What to Do Instead |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Real-time collaborative editing** | Requires CRDT/OT, WebSocket infrastructure, conflict resolution — 10x complexity for v1 | One person edits at a time; last write wins; coordinate via Slack |
| **In-app AI chat / prompt interface** | Claude Code is already the design interface; duplicating it creates two sources of truth and confuses the workflow | Keep AI in Claude Code; this tool only renders output |
| **Visual drag-and-drop editor** | Fights against Claude Code as the authoring tool; requires a full AST manipulation layer | Claude Code generates JSX; this tool renders it |
| **Comment threads / annotation chat** | Figma already does this; the team uses Slack for feedback | Link to Slack channel in the prototype view; no native comments |
| **Production code export** | This is a prototype tool, not a code generator; conflating the two creates false expectations about code quality | Mark prototypes clearly as prototypes; no "export to production" button |
| **Custom component library support** (v1) | Scope creep; the team uses standard MUI only | Hard-code MUI as the component library; design for extensibility but don't implement it |
| **User authentication for recipients** | Requiring sign-in to view a prototype kills the handoff workflow | View-only links are public (or intranet-accessible) with no auth |
| **Version control UI** (git UI in-app) | Git history is already available via Claude Code and the terminal | Surface "last updated" timestamp only; no branch/commit UI |
| **Design token editor UI** | Token system is not defined yet; building the editor before the tokens exist is premature | Accept theme JSON as input; editing happens outside the tool |
| **Automated screenshot / visual regression** | Useful, but a separate concern (Chromatic does this well) | Defer; if needed, integrate Chromatic as a separate CI step |

## Feature Dependencies

```
Live component rendering
  → Error boundary / graceful failure (required: crashes break everything)
  → Dark/light mode toggle (depends on rendering being stable)
  → Responsive preview (depends on rendering being in an iframe/container)
  → Component tree inspector (depends on rendered React tree being accessible)
    → Prop inspector panel (depends on component tree traversal)
    → Copy-to-clipboard import (depends on component identification)
    → Annotation layer (depends on component identification + MUI docs mapping)

Shareable link
  → Prototype list / gallery (users need to find prototypes to share)
  → Status workflow (sharing a draft vs approved prototype needs status context)
    → Status-gated sharing (depends on status workflow)

Inline text editing
  → Live component rendering (must render to find text nodes)
  → Role-based view switching (text handles only visible in Copywriter view)

Multi-screen navigation preview
  → Live component rendering (each screen is a rendered component)
  → Prototype list (screens within a prototype need a navigation model)

MUI theme preview
  → Live component rendering (theme applied at render time)
```

## MVP Recommendation

For v1 (ship to validate), prioritize:

1. **Live component rendering** with error boundaries — nothing else works without it
2. **Shareable link** — the core handoff mechanism
3. **Component tree + prop inspector** — the developer's primary value
4. **Inline text editing** — the copywriter's primary value
5. **Dark/light mode toggle** — always needed for MUI reviews
6. **Responsive preview** with MUI breakpoints — table stakes for mobile-aware teams
7. **Prototype list + search** — operational necessity beyond 3 prototypes
8. **Status workflow** — replaces "is this final?" Slack messages

Defer to v1.x or v2:

- **Role-based view switching** — valuable but can start with "always show all panels"
- **Multi-screen navigation** — start with single-screen; routing adds significant complexity
- **Annotation layer** — nice to have, not blocking handoff
- **MUI theme customization** — use default theme; design for extensibility
- **Status-gated sharing** — simple "draft" banner is good enough initially

## Competitive Positioning

| Tool | What It Does Well | Why This Tool Is Different |
|------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Storybook** | Isolated component stories, controls addon, docs | No multi-screen flows; not designed for non-developers; no copywriter workflow |
| **Figma** | Visual design, prototyping, commenting | Mockups not real components; theme/dark mode is manual; no prop inspection |
| **Zeplin** | Design handoff, style guide generation | No live component rendering; static inspection only |
| **Plasmic** | Visual builder for React components | Requires visual editor workflow; conflicts with Claude Code authoring |
| **Chromatic** | Visual regression, Storybook hosting | Focused on CI/testing, not interactive handoff or copy editing |

This tool's unique position: **real MUI components, rendered live, with role-specific views for the three stakeholders (designer/copywriter/developer), powered by Claude Code as the authoring interface.**
