<objective>
Human verification of all Phase 3 success criteria. Verify that the copywriter text editing, multi-screen navigation, and status workflow features work correctly end-to-end.

Purpose: Final quality gate before marking Phase 3 complete.

Output: Verification pass/fail for each success criterion.

  <what-built>
Complete Phase 3 implementation: Copy tab with inline text editing and live preview, multi-screen sidebar with drag-reorder, and status badge workflow.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Start the dev server if not running: `npm run dev`

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

**Criterion 1: Copy tab text editing**
1. Click the "Copy" tab in the right inspector panel
2. Verify all text strings from the prototype are displayed, grouped by component
3. Edit any text field — verify the change appears live in the preview iframe
4. Reload the page — verify the edited text persists (not reset to source value)
5. Verify modified entries show a colored indicator
6. Click the reset icon on a modified entry — verify it reverts to the source value

**Criterion 2: Text edits survive source update**
1. With text edits in place, modify the prototype source file (prototypes/sample/index.jsx) — change a text string that was NOT edited by the copywriter
2. Verify the copywriter's existing edits are preserved after the source update
3. If both designer and copywriter changed the same text, verify a conflict is shown in the Copy tab with both versions

**Criterion 3: Multi-screen navigation**
1. Create a second screen file: `prototypes/sample/screen-about.jsx` with a simple MUI component (e.g., a Typography with "About Page")
2. Verify the screen sidebar on the left shows both "Main" and "About" screens
3. Click "About" in the sidebar — verify the preview loads the About screen
4. Click "Main" — verify it switches back to the main screen

**Criterion 4: Status workflow**
1. Find the status badge (Chip) in the toolbar next to the prototype name
2. Click it — verify a menu opens with Draft, Review, and Approved options
3. Select "Review" — verify the badge changes to amber/warning color
4. Select "Approved" — verify the badge changes to green/success color
5. Reload the page — verify the status persists

Type "approved" if all criteria pass, or describe any issues found.
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" or describe issues</resume-signal>

All four Phase 3 success criteria from ROADMAP.md:
1. A copywriter can see all text strings in the Copy tab, edit any of them inline, and see the change reflected in the prototype preview without touching the source .jsx file
2. Text edits survive a prototype source update — a designer pushing a new version does not overwrite the copywriter's text changes
3. A prototype with multiple screens shows a navigation control (tab strip or sidebar), and clicking a screen label loads that screen in the preview
4. A designer can move a prototype from Draft to Review to Approved, and the current status is visible to anyone viewing the prototype

<success_criteria>
Human confirms all four Phase 3 success criteria pass. Phase 3 is complete.
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/03-copywriter-multi-screen-status/03-04-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
