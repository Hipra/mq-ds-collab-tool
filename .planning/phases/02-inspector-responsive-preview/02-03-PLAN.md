<objective>
Verify all Phase 2 success criteria through manual testing.

Purpose: Confirm that the inspector, component tree, prop inspector, breakpoint switcher, and tab panel all work correctly as an integrated system before marking Phase 2 complete.

Output: Human verification of all Phase 2 success criteria.

  <name>Verify Phase 2 success criteria</name>

  <action>
    Human verifies the complete inspector and responsive preview system:
    - AST-based component tree extraction from prototype source
    - Breakpoint switcher with 5 MUI breakpoints + Auto mode
    - Inspector panel with Copy/Components tabs
    - Component tree view with prop inspector
    - Hover/click-to-inspect in the preview iframe

    Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
    Open http://localhost:3000

    **1. Component tree (INSP-01):**
    - The Components tab in the right panel shows the MUI component hierarchy (e.g., Box > Paper > Stack > Button)
    - No raw HTML elements (div, span) appear in the tree
    - Components are shown with their tag names in monospace font

    **2. Prop inspector (INSP-02):**
    - Click a component in the Components tree
    - The prop inspector below shows the component name, source file:line, and all props as key-value pairs
    - String values are green, numbers blue, booleans purple
    - Verify the props match the actual source code in prototypes/sample/index.jsx

    **3. Breakpoint switcher (REND-04):**
    - Click "xs (360)" — iframe shrinks to 360px wide, centered with gray surround
    - Click "sm (600)" — iframe is 600px wide
    - Click "md (900)", "lg (1200)", "xl (1536)" — each shows correct width
    - Click "Auto" — iframe fills available space, no gray surround
    - IMPORTANT: the iframe is ACTUALLY resized (MUI responsive layouts inside should react), not CSS-scaled

    **4. Tab panel state (INSP-04):**
    - In Components tab, scroll down and select a component
    - Switch to Copy tab — see Phase 3 placeholder message
    - Switch back to Components tab — scroll position is preserved, component is still selected

    **5. Click-to-inspect in iframe:**
    - Hover over a component in the iframe preview — semi-transparent highlight overlay appears
    - The corresponding tree node highlights
    - Click a component in the iframe — tree auto-selects it and shows props

    **6. Panel toggle:**
    - Click the panel toggle button in the toolbar — panel hides
    - Click again — panel reappears with previous state intact
  </action>
  <verify>Human confirms all checks pass by typing "approved"</verify>
  <done>All four Phase 2 success criteria verified: component tree, prop inspector, breakpoint switcher, tab panel state preservation</done>
</task>

<verification>
All four Phase 2 success criteria from ROADMAP.md verified by human:
1. Clicking a component in the Components tab shows its MUI component name and all prop values from the source file
2. The component tree panel displays the MUI hierarchy without requiring React DevTools
3. Selecting xs, sm, md, lg, or xl from the breakpoint switcher resizes the preview iframe to that exact pixel width
4. The panel has two tabs — "Copy" and "Components" — and switching between them does not lose state in either tab

<success_criteria>
User confirms all four success criteria pass. Phase 2 is complete.
</success_criteria>
